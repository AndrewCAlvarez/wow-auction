----- GOALS -----
- Alphabetize realm select dropdown element
- Search
- Save realm-specific and commodity data (efficiency)
- Convert price to gold, silver & copper
- Prevent duplicate listing on multiple searches
- Refresh table on search
- Disable fetch requests 
- Implement use of sample data


----- SEARCH (Realm auction only)-----
NOTE: (I think I need a database and to slowly save the 
items I get back from my requests to the Blizz API. 
Otherwise, the app will be making hundreds of thousands 
of requests.)

1. Load auctions (so you can search)
2. Get search input from user 
3. Send search request to server
4. Item search from server to blizzard
5. Return search response from server
6. Display underneath the search bar possible results
7. On enter navigate to expanded search page which lists items
8. On displayed items underneath navbar and in expanded 
search page, clicked items navigate to auction table.
9. Send item data request to server
10. Search active auctions in loaded auction data
11. Return item auction data
12. Populate auction table with listings

- Search auctions that are region specific when 
typing into search bar
- Display the item name and icon


----- DATABASE -----
1. GET auctions from Blizz API 
2. Check if auction exists in DB by id
3. Add auctions to DB
4. Get item data for each unique item in auction DB
5. Save item data in DB

Reasoning behind updating and adding items: 
For a particular realm, get all current auctions and 
commodities with 1 request. Code a function which then creates
an array of item id's to make subsequent requests to Blizz API.
As the app iterates through all the auctions, it checks if 
an item id has already been added to the item DB, if false, then 
add that item id to the database and make a request to get that
item's data by id, if true, skip that item. Once the item's 
data has been retrieved, add that item's data to the DB.

Thus, slowly as items get added to the auction house, I can 
search my own private DB of items instead of Blizzard's for 
efficiency gains and to avoid the request limit imposed by 
Blizz API.
